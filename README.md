# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-SQL-

Overview:
The CORONA VIRUS pandemic has had a significant impact on public health and has created an urgent
need for data-driven insights to understand the spread of the virus. As a data analyst, I have been
tasked with analyzing a CORONA VIRUS dataset to derive meaningful insights and present My findings.
Dataset:
Description of each column in dataset:
Province: Geographic subdivision within a country/region.
Country/Region: Geographic entity where data is recorded.
Latitude: North-south position on Earth's surface.
Longitude: East-west position on Earth's surface.
Date: Recorded date of CORONA VIRUS data.
Confirmed: Number of diagnosed CORONA VIRUS cases.
Deaths: Number of CORONA VIRUS related deaths.
Recovered: Number of recovered CORONA VIRUS cases.

For tasks details, I use “Reference File for Corona data” which includes 16 questions for performing
detailed analysis. I have to find the answers by writing SQL queries
